Use of machine learning models on a large dataset to carry out the data oversampling over selected categorical features on the dataset to detect fraudulent transaction alerts and improve it's efficiency by comparing it with numerous other models.
The actual training and test datasets on which the model are trained is too large,so to access the file,check-out the Google-Drive link given below:
